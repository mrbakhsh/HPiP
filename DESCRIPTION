Description: HPiP (Host-Pathogen Interaction Prediction) uses an ensemble learning 
    algorithm for prediction of host-pathogen protein-protein interactions (HP-PPIs) 
    using structural and physicochemical descriptors computed from amino 
    acid-composition of host and pathogen proteins.The proposed package can effectively address 
    data shortages and data unavailability for HP-PPI network reconstructions. 
    Moreover, establishing computational frameworks in that regard will reveal 
    mechanistic insights into infectious diseases and suggest potential HP-PPI targets, 
    thus narrowing down the range of possible candidates for subsequent wet-lab experimental validations.
